NAME
    Vitacilina - ¡Ah, qué buena medicina!

DESCRIPTION
    A simple feeds engine exporter that uses YAML to get list of feeds and
    TT as templating system. Some people would call it an aggregator. It was
    intended to be a reliable Planet (<http://planetplanet.org>)
    alternative, then some development ideas evolved into rFeed
    (http://github.com/damog/rfeed). Vitacilina runs on production services
    on a couple of systems.

SYNOPSIS
     use Vitacilina;

     my $v = Vitacilina->new(
       config => 'config.yaml',
       template => 'template.tt',
       output => 'output.html',
       limit => '20',
     );

     $v->render;

FILES
  config
    The "config" parameter specifies the path to a YAML file specifying a
    list of feeds. Use this format:

     http://myserver.com/myfeed:
       name: Some Cool Feed
     http://feeds.feedburner.com/InfinitePigTheorem:
       name: InfinitePigTheorem
     ...

  template
    A "Template::Toolkit" file which will be taken as the template for
    output. Format:

     [% FOREACH p IN data %]
      <a href="[% p.permalink %]">[% p.title %]</a>
       by <a href="[% p.channelUrl %]">[% p.author %]</a>
      <br />
     [% END %]

    The "data" is an ordered array with a bunch of hashes with the simple
    data such as "permalink", "title", "channelUrl", "author", etc.

  output
    File path where the output will be written.

EXAMPLES
    Take a look at the "examples/" directory for fully working example.
